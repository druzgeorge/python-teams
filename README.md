# python-teams
Pythonic Implementation Of Collaborative Software

### Reason for its creation.
After using many collaborative platforms such as repl.it, Microsoft Teams, etc, I realised they all involved the same things.
 - Creation of an account
 - Creation of teams with other users
 - Shared code bases
 - Features that help users program together, text each other, set deadlines, update calendars, etc.
 
 I therefore used some basic python3 and flask to write this program which seeks to implement all these features soon.It has basic functionality up and running and is open for contribution.
